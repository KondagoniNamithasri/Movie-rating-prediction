# Movie Rating Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict movie ratings using regression techniques based on features like genre, director, and actors. 

## Dataset
The dataset contains historical movie data with attributes like:
- Genre
- Director
- Actors
- Release year
- User ratings (target variable)

## Approach
1. **Data Analysis**: Explored trends and distributions in the dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Extracted additional features like actor popularity and genre clustering.
4. **Model Building**: Built and tested various regression models to predict ratings.

## Results
- Final model: [Model Name] (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- Mean Absolute Error: `X`
- R-squared: `Y`

## Challenges
- Handling imbalanced data
- Identifying important features
